            <p>
                Hi, my name is Andrew Neuwirth. I currently work as a laborer by day out in the yard at Menards. In
                recent years I quickly turned into a computer nerd at night when I wasn't working, hanging out with
                friends, or playing soccer. I am currently taking part in a night time boot camp to work towards a
                career in coding so I can land a job in web development or computer programming when I am finished. I
                decided to take this boot camp to expand my horizons trying something new, interesting, and challenging
                while also doing something that I knew I would love doing when I was done. "If you do what you love,
                you'll never work a day in your life." - Marc Anthony
            <br>
            <br>
                At this point in time I have worked on a few select different projects. The first project I worked on
                was a
                website I had to edit to make it more accessable to handicap people. While working on this project I
                learned the importance of adding "alts" so visually impaired users can still access and navigate the
                website
                in a seemless manner. In doing so, I also learned that using key terms can not only assist users with
                handicaps, but also boost the site in search results. This allows the page to come up more often when a
                user
                may be searching for something the page has to offer. After that I made an Eminem fanpage from scratch
                creating all my own html and css stylsheet. This was my first lesson on "ground up" web page design. I
                was
                able to display pictures, make lists of my favorite albums and songs respectivly, give a brief
                description
                of who Eminem is and link his Wikipedia page, and displayed a video of him performing for BBC.
                I enjoyed working on those so much I even started coding in my freetime. I am currently working on a
                project
                page for a game I'm playing called World of Warcraft. Without going into too much detail, the page is
                dedicated to the class of Character I play in the game. It displays icons of the classes abilities,
                screenshots of my character in game, gave a short description of the playstyle and what I love about the
                character.
